Hello and welcome to my Neovim configuration! This is a work in progress and I am constantly updating it. I am using Neovim as my main text editor and I am trying to make it as efficient as possible.
If you want to use my configuration, you can clone this repository (or even fork it).
I am gladly taking feedback and suggestions :3
If you have any issues or questions, feel free to open an issue or contact me directly on Discord: \_a1mer or on Twitter: @AMulabeg

Current language support: C/C++, Lua, Python, Haskell and Java (but I don't really recommend you use it for that)
